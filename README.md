## Hi, I'm Kanishk 👋

👨‍💼 I'm a PhD student in physics-based deep learning in the [group of Prof. Thuerey](https://ge.in.tum.de/) at the Technical University of Munich (TUM), funded by [Munich Center of Machine Learning (MCML)](https://mcml.ai/). 🎓 I hold a master's with honours in [Computational Science and Engineering](https://www.cit.tum.de/cit/studium/studiengaenge/master-computational-science-engineering/) from TUM.  💡 My areas of interest are **scientific machine learning**, [**differentiable physics**](https://physicsbaseddeeplearning.org/diffphys.html), and **AI4Science** in general. 🌊 As a mechanical engineer, my first love is fluid dynamics. 💻 Previously I have worked as an Application Specialist for Cloud HPC Workflows at the [Leibniz Supercomputing Centre](https://www.lrz.de/en/) in Munich. 

### 💻 Projects

#### 1. [PRDP: Progressively Refined Differentiable Physics](https://kanishkbh.github.io/prdp-paper/)

This is my research at TUM that was published in [ICLR 2025](https://iclr.cc/virtual/2025/poster/30710). We developed a method that reduces training cost for bilevel optimization scenarios, especially in physics-based deep learning. Our method speeded up the training of a neural-hybrid model for 2D Navier Stokes by 78% against the baseline.

#### 2. [Fluidchen](https://github.com/kanishkbh/fluidchen_2021_group_h)

A finite differences solver for incompressible Navier-Stokes equations (in 2D) with heat transfer included. It contains own implementations of linear solvers: relaxation methods and Krylov subspace methods, is parallelized using MPI, and handles arbitrary geometries of the domain boundary as well as obstacles. This work was pursued in a team of 3 towards the Computational Fluid Dynamics Lab pratical course at TUM.

#### 3. [preCICE: Coupling data not associated with any mesh](https://github.com/precice/precice/pull/1549)

This is my contribution to the open-source coupling library [preCICE](https://precice.org/). I took up [this issue](https://github.com/precice/precice/issues/202) as a research assistant at the Chair of Scientific Computing at TUM. The PR is currently on hold due to changes in the software design and other recent decisions.


#### 4. [Speech2Text_Summarizer](https://github.com/kanishkbh/speech2text_summarization)
An intuitive web app that transcribes spoken input using whisper and gives summaries using the OpenAI API.
