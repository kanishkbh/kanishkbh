## Hi, I'm Kanishk ðŸ‘‹

I'm a master's graduate in [Computational Science and Engineering](https://www.cit.tum.de/cit/studium/studiengaenge/master-computational-science-engineering/) from the Techincal University of Munich (TUM). Currently I am working as a research assistant in physics-based deep learning in the group of [Prof. Thuerey](https://ge.in.tum.de/). My interests are **scientific computing**, **HPC**, **numerical simulations**, and **machine learning**. As a mechanical engineer, my first love is fluid dynamics. 

### ðŸ’» Projects

#### 1. [Fluidchen](https://github.com/kanishkbh/fluidchen_2021_group_h)

A finite differences solver for incompressible Navier-Stokes equations (in 2D) with heat transfer included. It contains own implementations of linear solvers: relaxation methods and Krylov subspace methods, is parallelized using MPI, and handles arbitrary geometries of the domain boundary as well as obstacles. This work was pursued in a team of 3 towards the Computational Fluid Dynamics Lab pratical course at TUM.

#### 2. [preCICE: Coupling data not associated with any mesh](https://github.com/precice/precice/pull/1549)

This is my contribution to the open-source coupling library [preCICE](https://precice.org/), which I wrote as a research assistant at the Chair of Scientific Computing at TUM. The PR is currently on hold due to changes in the software design and other recent decisions.


#### 3. [Speech2Text_Summarizer](https://github.com/kanishkbh/speech2text_summarization)
An intuitive web app that transcribes spoken input using whisper and gives summaries using the OpenAI API.


### ðŸŒ± What Iâ€™m Learning

Iâ€™m currently deepening my knowledge of **cloud technologies**, while exploring **ML for scientific computing**.
